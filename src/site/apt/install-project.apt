Install a Project

  If you are developing a Maven plugin or other components related to Maven, you need
  often to install artifacts into the local repository which is a little bit cumbersome. 

  With this component, this can be easily done via the following code parts:

+---  
   @Parameter ( defaultValue = "${session}", required = true, readonly = true )
   private MavenSession session;
   @Parameter ( defaultValue = "${project}", required = true, readonly = true )
   private MavenProject project;

   @Component
   private ProjectInstaller installer;
   ...
   public void execute()
   {
      
      ProjectInstallerRequest pir =
           new ProjectInstallerRequest()
             .setProject( project );

      installer.install( session.getProjectBuildingRequest(), pir );
      ...
   }
